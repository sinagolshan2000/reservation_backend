Project Documentation Status
The project's documentation is poor since I wrote the main code three years ago. I hope to improve the documentation someday. The Docker Compose files and some new features are recent additions.

You can view a list of the APIs at api/schema/swagger-ui/. This gives you a general idea of the endpoints, but the request and response bodies for some views are not clear. I hope to fix these issues in the future.

About the Project
This is a backend system for managing appointment reservations. There are business owners and customers. Business owners can create available appointments, and customers can reserve them. The system also includes many other related features.
