# Project Documentation

## Status

The project's documentation is poor since the main code was written three years ago. I hope to improve the documentation someday. The Docker Compose files and some new features, however, are recent additions.

You can view a list of the APIs at `api/schema/swagger-ui/`. This gives a general idea of the endpoints, but the request and response bodies for some views are not clear. I hope to fix these issues in the future.

## About the Project

This is a backend system for managing appointment reservations. It includes two types of users: **business owners** and **customers**. Business owners can create available appointments, and customers can reserve them. The system also includes many other related features.
